Once infected,\\nthe main factor to\\ninfluence the outcome is the age when the infection occurs; as high\\nas 70–90% of the perinatal infection will become chronic [1].\\nThus, prevention in infants as early as possible is critical, especially\\nin those born to HBV-infected mothers. The recommended\\nimmunoprophylaxis against hepatitis B,\\nsimultaneous use of\\nhepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and hepatitis B vaccine in\\nis most effective to prevent\\ninfants of HBV-infected mothers,\\nmother-to-child transmission of HBV.\\n\\nBreast milk is the optimal and natural food for infants. Although\\nWorld Health Organization and US Advisory Committee on\\nImmunization Practices postulate that chronic HBV infection of\\nthe mother could not be an argument against breastfeeding [2,3],\\nmany clinicians do not encourage HBV carrier mothers\\nto\\nbreastfeed their babies [4,5], since HBV DNA can be detected in\\nbreast milk [6] and breast lesions such as cracked or bleeding\\nnipples may increase exposure of infants to HBV. Recent studies\\n\\nreported that many HBV-infected mothers tend to formula-feed\\ntheir infants to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HBV [7–\\n9], although there are studies suggesting that breastfeeding does\\nnot add risk for the mother-to-child transmission of HBV [10–12].\\nIn this study, we compared the HBV infection rates in HBV-\\ninfected mothers’ children, who were breastfed and formula-fed\\nrespectively, to clarify whether breastfeeding may pose additional\\nrisk for the mother-to-child transmission of HBV.\\n\\nMaterials and Methods\\n\\nSubjects and serum specimens\\n\\nIn a retrospective study on the prevalence of hepatitis B surface\\nantigen (HBsAg) among 6398 pregnant women, whose serum\\nsamples were collected during 2002–2004, 429 (6.71%) women\\nwere positive for HBsAg and antibody against hepatitis B core\\nantigen (anti-HBc) [13]. From October 2009 to March 2010, we\\ninvited these mothers and their children to participate in the\\npresent study. After getting the written informed consent from 296\\nmothers, a total of 296 serum samples (,3 ml each) from their 296\\nchildren (aged 5–7 years) were collected. In addition, we invited\\n\\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org\\n\\n1\\n\\nJanuary 2013 | Volume 8 |\\n\\nIssue 1 | e55303\\n\\n\\x0c385 HBsAg-positive pregnant women who delivered their babies\\nin Zhenjiang Fourth People’s Hospital\\nfrom January 2006 to\\nDecember 2010 to join this study; 248 accepted our invitation and\\nconsented their own and their 250 children’s blood sampling\\nduring November 2011 to March 2012. Therefore, totally 546\\nchildren (2 pairs of twins) born to 544 HBsAg-positive mothers\\nwere enrolled in our investigation.\\n\\nEach mother was asked to complete a questionnaire, including\\ndemographic information of the mother and her child/children,\\nvaccination against hepatitis B, especially timely first dose vaccine\\nand administration of HBIG in the child. Formula-fed infants were\\nfed exclusively with formula, while breastfed infants were defined\\nas those who received breast milk for at least 2 weeks as previously\\ndescribed [11]; those who received breast milk fewer than 2 weeks\\nwere not included in either group. HBV serological markers and\\nHBV DNA in pregnant women were tested or obtained from the\\nhospital chart records. Administration of HBIG and the first dose\\nvaccine was further validated by the hospital discharge records.\\nThe injection of second and third doses vaccine was confirmed by\\nchildren’s vaccination records.\\n\\nThis study was performed according to the Declaration of\\nHelsinki and approved by the institutional review boards of\\nNanjing Drum Tower Hospital and Zhenjiang Fourth People’s\\nHospital. Each mother signed the written informed consent for\\nherself and her child.\\n\\nDetection of HBV serologic markers and HBV DNA\\n\\nAll serum samples were measured using commercially available\\nenzyme immunoassay kits (Huakang Biotech, Shenzhen; Kehua\\nBio-Engineering, Shanghai, China) for the presence of HBsAg,\\nantibody against HBsAg (anti-HBs), and anti-HBc. The HBsAg-\\npositive sera were further tested for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)\\nand antibody against HBeAg by enzyme immunoassay kits\\n(Huakang Biotech; Kehua Bio-Engineering). Quantitative levels\\nof anti-HBs were tested with microparticle immunoassay (Archi-\\ntect system, Abbott, North Chicago) and expressed in international\\nunits. HBV DNA was quantitatively measured using real-time\\nPCR assay (Shenyou Biotech, Shanghai, China), with the\\ndetection range 100–26107 IU/ml.\\n\\nStatistical analysis\\n\\nStatistical analysis was performed with the SPSS software (SPSS\\nStandard version 17.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Continuous\\nvariables normally distributed were expressed as mean 6 standard\\ndeviation and compared by t-test between two groups; quantitative\\ndata non-normally distributed were presented as median and\\ninterquartile range. Categorical variables were reported as number\\nand percentage and compared by x2 test or Fisher’s exact test\\nwhere appropriate. Binary logistic regression analyses were further\\nperformed to determine the independent role of the feeding mode\\nin the mother-to-child transmission of HBV or the immune\\nresponse against HBV, after adjusting for the confounding effect of\\nthe other factors significantly different (with a P,0.20) between\\nthe two groups; the results were expressed by the adjusted odds\\nratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A two-sided P\\nvalue,0.05 is considered statistically significant.\\n\\nResults\\n\\nPerinatal HBV Infection and Breastfeeding\\n\\nanti-HBV therapy before and during pregnancy. The children\\nwere at the age of 1–7 years (mean, 4.761.7). Of them, 137\\n(25.1%) were born to carrier mothers with HBeAg positive. All\\nchildren had been vaccinated against hepatitis B and 291 (53.3%)\\nreceived HBIG.\\n\\nOf the children, 397 (72.7%) were breastfed and 149 (27.3%)\\nothers were formula-fed. Compared with those in formula-fed\\ngroup, the mothers who breastfed their babies had similar ages\\nand delivery modes (Table 1). However, the mothers’ HBeAg-\\npositive rate in formula-fed group was significantly higher than\\nthat in breastfed group (49.0% vs. 15.9%, P,0.001). This is\\npossibly due to the notion that HBeAg-positive mothers are more\\ncontagious than HBeAg-negative carrier mothers. On the other\\nhand, children’s ages, gender ratios, and hepatitis B vaccine\\ncoverage and administration of HBIG were comparable between\\nthe two groups.\\n\\nHBV infection in breastfed and formula-fed children\\n\\nOverall, of the total 546 children, 13 (2.4%) were chronically\\ninfected with HBV since positive results of HBsAg, anti-HBc, and\\nHBeAg were observed in the children at the age of 1–7 years. Of\\nthe 13 children, 5 were administrated both HBIG and hepatitis B\\nvaccine after birth, but the 8 others were only vaccinated against\\nhepatitis B. Thus, the rate of chronic infection in the children with\\npassive-active prophylaxis was 1.7% (5/291), which was lower\\nin the children with only active\\nthan that\\nprophylaxis\\nImportantly, chronic HBV infection\\noccurred in 1.5% (6/397) of breastfed children and 4.7% (7/\\n149) of formula-fed children respectively (Table 2); the difference\\nwas borderline statistical significance (P = 0.063). Additionally, the\\nrate of self-resolved infection, presented as anti-HBc-positive but\\nHBsAg-negative, was 2.3% in breastfed children, comparable to\\nthat (5.4%) in formula-fed children (P = 0.114).\\n\\n(3.1%, 8/255)\\n(P = 0.278).\\n\\nIt has been recognized that mother-to-child transmission of\\nHBV is more likely to occur in infants of HBV-infected mothers\\nwith HBeAg positive and high HBV DNA levels [14,15]. In\\naccordance with this finding, we found that all 13 chronically\\ninfected children were born to HBeAg-positive mothers, while\\nnone of\\nthe children born to HBeAg-negative mothers was\\ninfected during follow-up. Thus, we further compared the\\ninfection rate in 137 children born to HBeAg positive mothers.\\nOf\\ntheir\\nthem, 63 were breastfed and 74 were formula-fed;\\nmothers had similar HBV DNA levels (breastfed 2.326106 vs.\\nformula-fed 2.476106 IU/ml, P = 0.613). Breast- and formula-fed\\ninfants had comparable prevalence of HBsAg (6/63, 9.5% vs. 7/\\n74, 9.5%, P = 0.990) and of anti-HBc-positive/HBsAg-negative\\n(7.9% vs. 10.8%, P = 0.567).\\n\\nTo further\\n\\ninvestigate whether breastfeeding may be an\\nindependent risk for the mother-to-child transmission of HBV,\\nwe performed two logistic regression analyses, one for the HBsAg\\npositivity and the other for the prevalence of anti-HBc. As shown\\nin Table 3, adjusting for the confounding effects of maternal\\nHBeAg status and the child’s age, breastfeeding was neither\\nassociated with chronic HBV infection (P = 0.995, aOR 0.99,\\n95%CI 0.28–3.58) or with the self-resolved infection (P = 0.301,\\naOR 0.57, 95%CI 0.20–1.65) in the children.

In addition,\\nbreastfeeding may not interfere with humoral immune response to\\nhepatitis B vaccine and HBIG. Therefore, we should not\\nrecommend HBV-infected mothers to formula-feed their children\\nto prevent mother-to-child transmission of HBV.\\n\\nin formula-fed children (Table 2). However,\\n\\nAlthough HBV DNA may be detected in breast milk, especially\\nin colostrum [6], in the present study, we observed that breastfed\\nchildren had statistically comparable rate of HBV infection with\\nthe HBV\\nthat\\ninfection rate in formula-fed children was higher than that in\\nbreastfed children (breastfed 4.7% vs.\\nthe\\ndifference was likely due to the higher mothers’ HBeAg-positive\\nrate in formula-fed group than that in breast-fed group (49.0% vs.\\n15.9%), since children born to mothers with HBeAg positive are at\\na higher risk of being infected with HBV [14] and other general\\n\\nformula-fed 1.5%);\\n\\ncharacteristics were comparable between the two groups (Table 1).\\nFurther analysis of the HBV infection in 137 children of HBeAg-\\npositive mothers showed that breastfed and formula-fed children,\\nwhose mothers had similar HBV DNA levels, were at comparable\\nrisk of being infected with HBV. Additionally, logistic regression\\nanalyses demonstrated that breastfeeding does not pose additional\\nrisk for mother-to-child transmission of HBV (Table 3).\\n\\nBefore the availability of HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine, Beasley\\net al [10] reported a cohort of 92 breastfed babies and 55 non-\\nbreastfed babies, whose mothers were HBsAg-positive during and\\nafter delivery. When the infants were tested at 3 or more months\\nold, with a mean follow-up period of 11 months, no significant\\ndifference was found in the acquisition rate of HBsAg (49% vs.\\n53%) or anti-HBs between the two groups. These results\\ndemonstrated no correlation between breastfeeding and the\\ndevelopment of HBV infection in children of carrier mothers. It\\nmay be related to the finding that the exposure to HBV associated\\nwith breast milk is negligible compared to that from maternal\\nblood and other body fluids during delivery or labor, and therefore\\nchildren rarely acquire HBV infection through breast milk with\\nweaker infectiousness [2]. With the availability of HBIG and\\nhepatitis B vaccine, a study conducted in United States found\\ncomparable rates of HBV transmission in breast- and formula-fed\\nchildren (0% vs. 3%) at the age of 9–15 months, indicating that\\nbreastfeeding does not add any risk for mother-to-child transmis-\\nsion of HBV [11]. Our data in the present study are in accordance\\nwith these reported results.\\n\\nTable 2.

Thus,\\nthe pregnant women in the present study had not been advised to\\nreceive antiviral therapy.\\n\\nThe main limitation in our study was its non-randomized\\ndesign. The children’s feeding modes were not randomly assigned\\nand the HBeAg-positive rate was much higher in the mothers of\\nthe formula-fed children; this may contribute to the relatively\\nlower prevalences of HBsAg and anti-HBc in breastfed children\\n(Table 2). To overcome the bias due to maternal HBeAg status\\nand other different characteristics between the breastfed and\\nformula-fed children, we further performed logistic regression\\nanalyses to evaluate the impact of breastfeeding on the mother-to-\\nchild transmission. Our results indicated that breastfeeding was\\nnot associated with the HBV infection in the children (Table 3).\\nThere may be other potential bias or even unknown different\\nfactors in the non-randomized study. Nevertheless, the compara-\\nble prevalence of HBsAg in formula-fed and breastfed children\\nindicates that breastfeeding does not\\nincrease maternal-infant\\ntransmission of HBV. Additionally, we did not consider it ethically\\njustified to decide the children’s feeding modes.\\n\\nIn view of these results, we conclude that breastfeeding is not a\\nrisk factor for mother-to-child transmission of HBV after the\\nrecommended prophylaxis is implemented. Therefore, regardless\\nof mothers’ status of HBeAg, clinicians should encourage HBV-\\ninfected mothers\\ninfants with available\\nto breastfeed their\\nimmunoprophylaxis against hepatitis B.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nWe thank Dr. Biyun Xu for the excellent statistical analyses, Ms. Yongchun\\nBi and Ms. Tianli Zhu for the quantitative detection of anti-HBs and anti-\\nHBc, and Mr. Lei Li for the quantification of HBV DNA.
